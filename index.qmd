# Welcome to the IDEG workshop on Mediation Analysis and Directed Acyclic Graphs {.unnumbered}

During this short workshop, you will be introduced to traditional
mediation approaches before exploring the theory of causal mediation, as
a method to investigate disease mechanisms in the context of diabetes.

We hope this will be the beginning of your journey in mediation analysis
and open the door to more theory-grounded studies in aetiological
diabetes epidemiology! The workshop is offered as part of the
[International Diabetes Epidemiology Group (IDEG) Trainee
Workshop](https://www.ideg-diabetes.org/idegtraineeworkshop) in Bangkok,
Thailand, on 3 April 2025.

The workshop requires some pre-workshop preparation to install R and R
Studio as well as some necessary packages and data. Furthermore, for
those unfamiliar with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), some introductory
reading and exercises are included in the pre-workshop materials.

The face-to-face workshop will consist of a combination of brief
lectures and hands-on coding practice in R code-along sessions. We
encourage students to discuss the materials and network during the
entire Trainee Workshop. The instructors will be available to answer
questions throughout the day.

üóì April 3, 2025 üè® Bangkok, Thailand

### The target audience

PhD students and postdoctoral researchers working with clinical and
epidemiological studies of diabetes, its causes and consequencesits
endocrinology, that are planning to conduct mediation analysis or that
are interested in widening their analysis toolkit.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To make the most of our workshop in Bangkok, please complete the
pre-workshop tasks before you arrive. This will ensure we can start our
sessions smoothly and dive right into the content!

1.  Finish the [Pre-Workshop Tasks](/preamble/precourse.qmd)
2.  Get familiar with [Directed Acyclic
    Graphs](/preamble/Introduction-to-DAGs.qmd)

## Building the workshop

The worskhop material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
materials for this workshop are adapted from the Mediation Analysis
Course. You can find the full materials for that course on the
[`steno-aarhus/mediation-analysis-course`](https://github.com/steno-aarhus/IDEG-mediation-course)
GitHub repository.
