# Welcome to the course {.unnumbered}

<!-- Daniel 10 min -->


Welcome to the short workshop on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and mediation analysis!

During this 75-minute course, you will learn about traditional mediation approaches before exploring the theory of causal mediation, accompanied by hands-on R coding practice. We hope this will be the beginning of your journey in mediation analysis and open the door to more interesting research studies!

## Overall learning outcomes

::: callout-note
## The overall course objective

To provide participants with the knowledge, tools and skills to
implement modern mediation analysis for investigation of disease
mechanisms.
:::

The more specific learning outcomes include:

-   **Explain** the theoretical concepts and statistical methods
    regarding traditional and modern mediation analysis applied to
    basic, clinical and epidemiological research on diabetes and
    endocrine diseases
-   **Perform** traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis using
    R software
-   **Present** results from mediation analysis according to the current
    mediation analysis reporting guidelines
-   **Interpret** results from mediation analysis and suggest relevant
    sensitivity analyses for mediation analyses
-   **Discuss** the strengths, limitations and assumptions of
    traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis

### The target audience

PhD students and postdocs conducting research within the field of basic
science, clinical, and epidemiological studies on diabetes and
endocrinology, that are planning to conduct mediation analysis or that
are interested in widening their analysis toolkit.

### Prerequisites


To make the most of our training course in Bangkok, please complete the pre-course tasks before you arrive. This will ensure we can start our sessions smoothly and dive right into the content!
