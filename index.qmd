# Welcome to the IDEG workshop on Mediation Analysis and Directed Acyclic Graphs {.unnumbered}



During this short workshop, you will be introduced to traditional mediation approaches before exploring the theory of causal mediation, as a method to investigate disease mechanisms in the context of diabetes.

We hope this will be the beginning of your journey in mediation analysis and open the door to more theory-grounded studies in aetiological diabetes epidemiology! The workshop is offered as part of the [International Diabetes Epidemiology Group (IDEG) Trainee Workshop](https://www.ideg-diabetes.org/idegtraineeworkshop) in Bangkok, Thailand, on 3 April 2025.

The workshop requires some pre-course preparation to install R and R Studio as well as some necessary packages and data. Furthermore, for those unfamiliar with Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), some introductory reading and exercises are included in the pre-course materials.

The face-to-face workshop will consist of a combination of brief lectures and hands-on coding practice in R code-along sessions. We encourage students to discuss the materials and network during the entire Trainee Workshop. The instructors will be available to answer questions throughout the day.

## Overall learning outcomes

::: callout-note
## The overall workshop objective
This course introduces participants to the fundamental principles, analytical tools, and essential skills needed to understand and apply modern mediation analysis for investigating disease mechanisms
:::




The more specific learning outcomes include:

-   **Explain** the theoretical concepts and statistical methods regarding traditional and modern mediation analysis applied to basic, clinical and epidemiological research on diabetes and endocrine diseases
-   **Perform** traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis using R software
-   **Present** results from mediation analysis according to the current mediation analysis reporting guidelines
-   **Interpret** results from mediation analysis and suggest relevant sensitivity analyses for mediation analyses
-   **Discuss** the strengths, limitations and assumptions of traditional, causal and modern mediation analysis


### The target audience

PhD students and postdoctoral researchers working with clinical and epidemiological studies of diabetes, its causes and consequencesits endocrinology, that are planning to conduct mediation analysis or that are interested in widening their analysis toolkit.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Prerequisites

To make the most of our training course in Bangkok, please complete the pre-course tasks before you arrive. This will ensure we can start our sessions smoothly and dive right into the content!
