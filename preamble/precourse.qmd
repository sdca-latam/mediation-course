## Installing programs {#sec-intall-r-packages}

If you are a workshop attendee and have any trouble with installation
locally, please reach out to us directly!

1️⃣ Install R (Latest Version): If you have not already done so, please
download and install the latest version of R based on your operating
system:

<https://cran.r-project.org/>

2️⃣ Install RStudio: This is a separate program that provides an
intuitive user interface with R.

Visit RStudio Download Page:
<https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/> Click "Download
RStudio" and follow the instructions.

3️⃣ Check Your R Version If you already have R installed, check your
version to ensure compatibility:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| results: asis
R.Version()
```

If your R version is 4.3.1 or later, you're good to go!

4️⃣ Install Required R Packages: To ensure you have all necessary
packages, run the following command in R:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("tidyverse")
pak::pkg_install("DiagrammeR")
pak::pkg_install("downlit")
pak::pkg_install("furrr")
pak::pkg_install("here")
pak::pkg_install("knitr")
pak::pkg_install("mediation")
pak::pkg_install("NetCoupler")
pak::pkg_install("rmarkdown")
pak::pkg_install("survival")
pak::pkg_install("xml2")
pak::pkg_install("here")
pak::pkg_install("BS1125/CMAverse")
pak::pkg_install("ggdag")
pak::pkg_install("ggplot2")
```

If installation of a package does not work using the "pak" package, then
use:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| results: asis

install.packages("name-of-package")
```

If you have issues with the CMA package, you could also try this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| results: asis

install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BS1125/CMAverse")
```

## Brush up on your DAG knowledge before the workshop

Some concepts in the mediation workshop are explained using Directed
Acyclic Graphs. It is important that you understand what they are and
how we use them in observational epidemiology. We have put together a
very general introduction to DAGs. If you have not worked with DAGs
before, please take some time to go through this [introduction to
DAGs](/preamble/Introduction-to-DAGs.qmd) to familiarize yourself with
them.

## Download the data and repository {#sec-download-data}

You can follow all the teaching material on this website. For the
exercises, you will need to use the datasets we have created. You can
either download the entire repository (recommended) or simply download
the data from our github. We recommend that you do not do this before
March 31, in the afternoon as we will making updates until then.

### Download repository

1.  Open a new session of R in RStudio. If you are in a project, go out
    of that project.

2.  Using RStudio's New Project menu item: "File -\> New Project -\>
    Version control -\> Git"

3.  Keeping RStudio open, open your browser and go to our
    [repository](https://github.com/sdca-latam/mediation-course.git)

4.  Then, Click on the green "code" icon and copy-paste

5.  Now go back to R and put in what you just copy-pasted under
    "Repository URL." You should also select where this project should.

6.  Click "create project" and you should now have all materials there.

### Download the data

If you want to only download the workshop data. You can go to
[here](https://github.com/sdca-latam/mediation-course/tree/main/data)
