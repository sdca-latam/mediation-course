## Description
This short workshop on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and mediation analysis
is offered as part of the [International Diabetes Epidemiology Group (IDEG) 
Trainee Workshop](https://www.ideg-diabetes.org/idegtraineeworkshop) in 
Bangkok, Thailand, on 3 April 2025.

The workshop aims to introduce students to mediation analysis as a method to
investigate disease mechanisms in the context of diabetes and endocrine diseases.

The workshop requires some pre-course preparation to install R and R Studio as well as
some necessary packages. Furthermore, for those unfamiliar with DAGs, some introductory
reading and exercises are included in the pre-course materials.

The face-to-face workshop will consist of a combination of brief lectures and R code-along sessions.
We encourage students to discuss the materials and network during the entire Trainee Workshop.
The instructors will be available to answer questions throughout the day.

This repository contains the lesson, lecture, and assignment material
for the course, including the website source files and other associated
course administration files.
